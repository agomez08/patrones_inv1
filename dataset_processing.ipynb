    "In this notebook, we present a series of steps to illustrate the process of cleaning out a dataset before using it for a learnng task related to patterns-recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this purpose, we are going to use the **1.6 million UK traffic accidents** dataset that can be downloaded from the next link: https://www.kaggle.com/daveianhickey/2000-16-traffic-flow-england-scotland-wales\n",
    "\n",
    "From its documentation, this dataset contains the most relevant information for police reported accidents in the UK between 2005 and 2014, although 2008 is missing. Each of the 1.6 million accidents reported in this dataset is described with 33 features (33 columns for each instance).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will attempt to visualize and understand the most relevant contents of the dataset while implementing improvements that can make it more suitable for a learning task. Considering that the type of pre-processing to apply may change depending on the application, we will pretend that this data will be used to train some sort of model that can predict the probability of an accident for a given set of features. Considering this, we will suggest some of the features are removed since they may not be relevant for an application like this one.\n"
